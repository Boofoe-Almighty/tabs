Artist: Elder
Album: Omens (2020)

Transcription: Sean Eidemiller (seidemiller@gmail.com)

As of right now (January 2021), there exists no live video footage of the band
playing any of the tracks from Omens. Because of this, I can't be sure that what
I've transcribed is entirely accurate. I believe the *notes* to be mostly
correct (except for the few parts that are difficult to hear, which I've
highlighted), but I don't know that Nick and Michael are playing their
respective parts the same way (in the same part of the neck, for example). Ergo,
when video does begin to surface, there may be slight revisions made to the
transcriptions.

Tonally speaking, Nick and Michael recently did a "Rig Rundown" with Premier
Guitar in which they describe the guitars, amps, and pedals used to record the
album...
